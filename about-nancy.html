    <h1> Nancy Wachiuri </h1>
    <h2><em> A little about Me.</em></h2>
      <p> I am a graduate of <strong>Kenyatta University</strong> School of Environmenal Studies and I practise in the field of <strong>Mapping and Surveying</strong> </p>
      <P> Below is a picture of part of my work</P>
      <img src="surveyor-at-work.jpg" alt="Survey work">
      <p>Being competent in programmig is essential for may disciplines including survey and mapping</p>
      <p>Since it is tedious and inefficient to perform repetitive tasks I am taking up the <em>software development</em> program at <a href="https://moringaschool.com/">Moringa School</a> to be able to automate my processes.</p> 
      <h3>The top programming languages in mapping are:</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Java</li>
          <li>C</li>
          <li>C++</li>
          <li>C#</li>
          <li>JavaScript</li>
          <li>Python</li>
          <li>PHP</li>
          <li>Perl</li>
          <li>Visual Basic .NET</li>
          <li>Objective-C</li>
        </ul>
      <h3>The following is a list of projects I have created since I started the program at Moringa</h3>
