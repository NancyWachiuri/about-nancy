    <h2><em> A little about Me.</em></h2>
        <p> I am a graduate of <strong>Kenyatta University</strong> School of Environmenal Studies and I practise in the field of <strong>Mapping and Surveying</strong> </p>

          <img src="surveyor-at-work.jpg" alt="Survey work">
        <p>Being competent in programming is essential for may disciplines including survey and mapping. Since it is tedious and inefficient to perform repetitive tasks I am taking up the <em>software development</em> program at <a href="https://moringaschool.com/t">Moringa School</a> to be able to automate my processes.</p>
      <div class="survey">
        <p>Land surveying involves locating and measuring both man-made and natural features using the principles of mathermatics, geometry and other services. It allows you to understand your land boundaries, the status of land ownership and the rights, restrictions and interests in property.</p>

      <div class="map">
        <p>Mapping is the process of inputing data to a software to produce a map. Maps are one of the most effectifve ways to present data.</p>
